Spy web or Spy mobile //This is capture object by doing some action in application
Record //This is used to record the test by doing manually and recording
Run //Used to run the test
Debug  //Used to debug the test
Stop  //Used to stop the test
Build CMD //Used to create command line tool. So that we dont want to open the UI to run. we can run using command
Git //Used to integrated Git repo

Test Explorer:  //This option is available above the test cases
Here it will test cases, object repo, test suite, data files etc
we can filder with name and component

Keyword browser:
This will show all available keywords

Editor:
For test, it will show manual, code, variable and integration.  //manual is to manually add a step in test, code is code the action or step, variable will show all global variable
For object repository, it will give the option to add object or identifier
For test suite, it will the option to add test case in test suite. We can enable or disable any test here
For data files, it will give the option to add test data via excel, csv, text or db etc
For keyword, this will give option to edit the keyword behaviour


views:
This will give option to view global variables, console output, test cases status pass/fail etc

To skip the step in test we can right click on the step and then click on disable
To skip the test in suite, we can disable checkbox in run 


Tutorial 4: First Test
-------------
3 way we can write the test

1. Record and play //We can click record option and give url and open browser and record all the action and then we replay the same
2. Manual mode //Here we will manually add keyword of each action and do
3. Scripting //Here we can use java or groovy code to create test scripts


Tutorial 5: Record and reply
-----------
To record:
1. Click record button
2. Give url and select browser
3. Click record button
It will launch the browser
4. Do the action which we wanted to record in the link
Katalon studio will capture all the action
5. Then click stop button

6. Option- If we wanted to add validation, we can give that in item
(It will save the objects which has been captured during recording. Give the path where we wanted to save)
7. To reply or to run, We can click run button and select the browser where we wanted to run


Tutorial 6: Create test using manual mode
----------
Using spy web we can able to capture the object
Click spy web, give url and browser and select the object in browser which we need to capture.
Then click the short cut or capture object to capture the object
This will capture the locator
Now we can save the object in folder which we wanted to save in object repo


Now click new button and click test case,
Select the folder where we wanted to add the test
Give the test name and give ok
Click on add button to add item keyword
We can give object and value if needed
To verify we can add verification item like verify text present
Once done, save it
Then click on run button to run on chrome
To run in other browser, click arrow button in run button and then select the browser.
It will run the test on given browser.

We can handle whether we have to stop or continue if any failure in between.
Go to -> project -> settings -> Test case -> Select any (stop on failure / continue on failure / optional) //stop means it will stop if some step got failed, continue mean it will continue even if it fails. but the result will be failed, optional means it wont show as failure even if some test fails if it can move till the end of test )

To handle the same in step level:
Select the step, right click on the step -> select any (stop on failure / continue on failure / optional) //stop means it will stop if some step got failed, continue mean it will continue even if it fails. but the result will be failed, optional means it wont show as failure even if some test fails if it can move till the end of the test )

//We can drag and drop any keyword or object to the test.


Tutorial 7: Creating script in script mode
-------------------------
we can use java or groovy to write the script

We can capture the object using spy mode and save the required object in object repository
To create test, click on add button and give test case name and give ok
Then we can see the test case, we can click on script option, so that it will switch to script mode
We can see the default package/class which has been already imported.

Now we can give WebUI.methoname() or mobile.methodname()
It will show the suggession of available methods.

While writing, we can drag and drop the object, so that it will added in script
To no run any step, we can give like not_run before the line
not_run: WebUI.methodname()

Whatever we write in script mode, it will show the same step in manual mode
Whatever we write in manual mode, it will show the same step in script mode
So it is easy to find script and manual steps


Tutorial 8: How to create and run Test Suite
---------------
Test suite is used to categorize or group the set of test cases

To create Test suite
Add -> Test suite -> Give test suite name

To add test cases in test suite
Select the test suite -> add -> select test cases which we wanted to add in selected test suite

To run test suite
Select the test suite -> Click run button (Select browser or device)

To view log:
We can view the result in Log viewer

To view report:
Report->Select the test suite. It will show the result of each test
Select the test cases. It will show the result of each step
Select step. It will show the log of each step
We can see the summary of report by clicking summary
We have filter to filter pass / fail / error etc
We can able to see logs of each test cases and each steps in test case

In Test suite -> Execution information, we can handle below
Timeout
Retry
Add mail recipients
View last run report
//Select Test suite -> Execution information, we can give timeout or retry or add mail recipients or view last run report





Other notes:
-----------
------------
//If need we can create folder in test case and we can add the test cases into the folder.
Default timeout is available in Project -> settings -> execution ->
